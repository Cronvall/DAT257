Social Contract group 12

How do we handle bookings and communicate?

- Communication regarding admin stuff goes in messenger group. 
- Communication regarding more developing stuff goes in Slack
- Communication only occurs between 8-17 on weekdays. If not you get 1 pin per message
- If you come late you 1 pin per minute. 15 pins equals brining fika to the next meeting. 
- If nothing else stated, meeting is in person. If you have a reason its allowed to be on zoom. If so, write early so others can adjust. 

Document- and filemanagement

- When you implement a change someone else in the group needs to review it and confirm it before itÂ´s implemented. 

Decisionmaking

- Decissions regarding the overall funtionality and look of the product are to be made with mayority. Small details and overall coding is up to each member of the group.
