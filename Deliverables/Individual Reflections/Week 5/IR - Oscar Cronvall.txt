Week 5

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
   The upcoming week I want to make all the components in the league dashboard work.
   This is a big task since it requires some redesigning of the backend but would actualy bring
   usefullness to the graphs and history based analysis of your results.
   

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    This week I've spent alot of time connecting the backend to frontend in the league dashboard.
    
    
    
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    The largest change this week is that I've collaborated alot with both Keivan and Johannes since they
    have a way better knowledge then me on how the backend functions in detail.
