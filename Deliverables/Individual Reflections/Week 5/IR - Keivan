Week 5

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I would like to learn design principles, how to adapt your application design in regard to the user so they can navigate through the application without any concerns, in other words, creating a good user experience.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I helped with some implementations for updating a users portfolio when buying/selling.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have gotten a better understanding om how to work with jpa entities, but I would want to get a general better understanding on how to work with react
