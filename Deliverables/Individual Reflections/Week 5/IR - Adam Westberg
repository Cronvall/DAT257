What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
- I want to learn better how to set up a really succesful sprint, it seems like a fine art.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
- I have primarly helped with adjustments for making the landing page clearer, i developed more within TypeScript and i had the role of Scrum Master again.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
-Reflected a bit more about the SM role.  This time we were all aligned on how we should divide the work this penultimate sprint and how we should wrap things up.
I found it a bit difficult to be of support towards the more complex tasks this time due to inferior software skills, it seems like a very important thing to have a good grip of the toolset in order to be a good SM. 
I think my strength rather is within prioritizing the backlog and making sure the team is not doing things out of scope and in the right order - maybe thats also a good quality of a SM but more so for a PO.
