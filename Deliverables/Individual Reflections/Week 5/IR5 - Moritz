Individual reflection Moritz Berger

1.	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Still pretty much the same as previous sprints but it would by nice to learn more generally about the frontend programming.
2.	What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This sprint I hade the role as product-owner. I also implemented an image-carousel on the homepage to showcase the application before registering as a user. 
3.	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have improved my understanding of react a bit, I feel like I understand all of the code better now than last week.
