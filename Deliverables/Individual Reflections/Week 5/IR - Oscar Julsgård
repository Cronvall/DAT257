Week 5

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
-	More about programming in general and the different techniques and languages we are using
	
What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
-	I joined Moritz and made some improvements on the image carousel that he had done. We also looked at the portfolio part of the profile page
	
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
-	Very much same as last week: improved on pair programmeing, where me and Moritz have worked together
