Week 4

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
   I want to better understand diffrent style libraries to design our website better.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    This week I've spent most my time developing the transaction view for the 
    frontend and made it fetch data from the rest api.

    
    
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
