Week 4

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
-	I would like to learn more about how the database we are using works, and how it will be affected when users are buying/selling stocks
	
What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
-	Me and Moritz have worked on the portfolio page, which we started last week. My computer broke down, and I have had some issues when setting up the software and work environment on my new one.
	
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
-	Have improved on pair programmeing, where me and Moritz have worked together
