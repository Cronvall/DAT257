Individual reflection Moritz Berger

1.	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Still pretty much the same as previous sprints but it would by nice to learn how to use React.
2.	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This sprint I had the role as Scrummaster and apart from that I worked together with Oscar Julsgård on the portfolio page. Due to the fact that the ablity to buy and sell stock is not completetly finished yet it was a bit difficult and will continue on to the next sprint. 
3.	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
We have improved our pair-programming skills after reading the guide. Otherwise no major changes.
