Week 4

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
   The upcoming week I want to gain more insight into the backend of our project.
   Unfortunatly most of my time has been spent on the frontend with very little time spent on the backend.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    This week I've spent most my time styling and refactoring/adding the component we want to
    have in the league dashboard. 
    
    
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    This week I've tried refactoring previous "slopy" written code.
    This has gone great but fortunatly enough our code debt wasn't that significant.
