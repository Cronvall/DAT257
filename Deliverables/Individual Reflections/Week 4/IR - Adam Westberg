What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
- Continue learning how a good scrum master and a good PO work to create a well functioning team, we are seeing improvements but its always possible to improve.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
- I have primarly helped with adjusteing the TAs requirements of the Create league page. I learned how to work more with TypeScript which was fun. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
- Learned more about typescript. We are getting closer as a team and it feels more and more fun to work together.
