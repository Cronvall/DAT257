Week 1

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
- Get to know the spring boot framework better. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
- I began working with the stock api. I wrote a rest api in the backend with stock data. Better communication.
