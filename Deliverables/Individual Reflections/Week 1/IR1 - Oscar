WEEK 1

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
- I am looking forward to learning more about how to work effectively in teams when developing software. During the courses we have taken I have gained theoretical knowledge in the subject, but it will be fun to put this in to practice in an agile way together with the team.

- Overall project strucuture and planning, will focus more on code next sprint
