Individual reflection Moritz Berger

1.	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I would like to learn more about the process of creating the software. Both the front end and back end would be nice to understand better. It would also be nice to get a better understanding and more intuitive workflow regarding the agile work and scrum. 

2.	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I created the Mock-up for the project in figma and worked with the overall initial front end layout of the product. I also attended our team-meetings where we discussed what features should be implemented. 

I think that I need to deep-dive into the coding part to have a better ability to help out with the coding-specific tasks. 

3.	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
It´s the first sprint so no changes/improvements yet.
