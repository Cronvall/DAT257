Week 2

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
- I want to be better at pair-programming. Get better at scoring user stories. Write CSS faster.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
- I build a UI for the stock data page and connected the frontend to the backend. Frontend can fetch data from the backend.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
-   Better team structure based from an agile point of view
