Week 2

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

  I would like to learn more specifically how different actors work in a scrum sprint, like what is the practical difference between a product owner and scrum master. 
  Learn how to use React

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
  
  Worked with the backend to be able to connect the frontend properly, worked with spring boot configurations and validation when authenticating user.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
  
  Used more agile practices like sorting user stories and predicting the amount of work better since last sprint
