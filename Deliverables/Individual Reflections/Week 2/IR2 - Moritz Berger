Individual reflection 2 Moritz Berger

1.	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I would still like to learn more about the process of creating the software. Both the front end and back end would be nice to understand better. I would also like to learn more about pair programming.

2.	What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I worked together with Fabian to get a working log-in page that authenticates the user that wants to log in against the users that are registered. Both frontend and backend.

I think that I need to deep-dive more into the coding part to have a better ability to help out with the coding-specific tasks. 

3.	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
The workflow has improoved and we had clearer roles and goals for the sprint.
