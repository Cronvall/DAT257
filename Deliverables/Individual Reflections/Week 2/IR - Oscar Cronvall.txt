Week 2

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
    The upcoming week I want to learn understand how we would implement the nextjs/auth library on our frontend application
    in the best way. We have started to think about how we would authenticate users to show them the correct information on the screen
    and I think understanding the nextjs/auth library will help us solve this issue.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    Last week I said I wanted to understand the connection between backend and frontend better and I 
    have done this but only for a few hours. Most of my time has been spent building up the landingpage and
    a few React components so that we can have a coherent design throughout the application. All components haven't
    been added to the main branch yet but most of them are in tweeking.
    
    
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    The biggest change this week is that everyone in the group has been able to contribute code to the projects
    wich has in turn increased our velocity in a very substancial way. This is great and has been lots of fun :D
