Individual reflection Moritz Berger

1.	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Although there has been som improovement on this part, I would still like to learn more about the process of creating the software. I would also like to get even better at pairprogramming since it seems like a useful tool to have. I am starting to get a hang of the coding process a bit better but I still think it´s difficult, so it is nice to do it together with someone. Also how the different roles in scrum work, it´s getting clearer for each sprint so that´s good.

2.	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This sprint I worked together with Oscar Julsgård on some frontend parts of the application. Specifically frontend for the league-rooms. There is still some work to be done though.

I think that I need to deep-dive more into the coding part to have a better ability to help out with the coding-specific tasks and learn even more about scrum. 

3.	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
This week we had a product owner so it was easier to know who does what and how the work is distributed. Some improovements since last sprint is also in the pair-programming part and how the different roles in scrum work together to get a nice workflow. Also how to write good user-stories which one can get a better understanding from.
