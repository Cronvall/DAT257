What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
- I feel that I start to understand the agile process more, but there is still room for improvments. Still lacking a bit in understanding of the technologies we use. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
- I have had limited time this week and such my contributions have been lacking. I countinued improving the login. The next sprint I will help my team with ideas, communications and code as done in previous weeks. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
- I think we still lack some communication regarding what everyone is working on and how we should to the pair programming.
