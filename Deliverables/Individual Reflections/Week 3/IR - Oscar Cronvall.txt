Week 3

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
    I would like to gain experience either posing as the groups PO or SM next week. Other than that I would 
    like to work on the portfolio management aspects of our application.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    This week I've made our login, register and authentication services. We didn't end up using nextjs/auth as
    I thought we would last week. Instead we went with a simpler design using browser cookies to authenticate.
    This isn't optimal for certain corner case nor for security. But it's a well working provisonal service.
    
    
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    The biggest change this week was that we colaborated more since most of our work colided in the
    development of leagues and users portfolios. This was fun since I gained insight into how the services other
    members have developed works.
