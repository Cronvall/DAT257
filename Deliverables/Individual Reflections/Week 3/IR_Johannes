Week 3

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
  I would like to get to know react better so that i can complete all parts of a userstory which requires frontend and backend.
  

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
  
  I was working on authentication on the backend side together with implementing encryption for our passwords in the database.
  Next week i would like to pair program more to understand some parts of the codebase better

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
  
  Plan what has to be done better at the beginning of the sprint so that i don't have to add work during the sprint.
