What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
- How a good scrum master and a good PO work to create a well functioning team. Also how the JSON files are structured in our database

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
- I have communicated, collaborated, and maintained a positive attitude to contribute and steer the team's deliveries. I plan to reflect on our progress, ideate new solutions, and support my team members to do better in next sprint.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
- Learned more about the database structure of our program, and what a POs role in the process is. However, as stated above, i would like to know more about it.
