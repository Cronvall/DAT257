What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I want to understand better how I can create relations between JPA entities and make them work together using good practice.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
Worked on some routing, logic and database questions for creating and joining rooms. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Have gotten better understanding on JPA entities and how the frontend can work with the backend
